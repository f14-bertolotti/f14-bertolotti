# Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!

I'm a researcher currently working in **AI**, with a past life spent deep in the trenches of **programming languages** and **compilers**.  
If you're curious about the more academic side of what I do, feel free to browse my  
📚 **[Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mFYoE-4AAAAJ)**.

I also keep a small **research blog** where I jot down things I'm learning, half-baked ideas, and early explorations:

If social media is more your vibe, I’m quite active on **X**, where I post bite-sized summaries of interesting papers from the daily arXiv feed:

## 🌱 Open Source Contributions

Starting in 2025, I've been trying to give back more to the open-source ecosystem.  
Whenever I catch myself monkey-patching something in a Python virtual environment, I now try to open a PR instead.  
It’s a work in progress-but a fun one.

Some of the projects I’ve contributed to:

- 🔧 **[opencompass](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass)**
- ⚡ **[lighteval](https://github.com/huggingface/lighteval)**
- 🚀 **[vllm](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)**

Thanks for stopping by! If any of my work or repos spark your interest, feel free to reach out—or open an issue/PR. Always happy to chat tech, research/
